/// Message Logger implementation to keep track of different user transactions:
/// The user has the options to:
/// - Convert a decimal number to binary
/// - Uppercase the longest word in the input string
/// - Reverse the input string
/// Everytime the user does something, it should log the ID, TimeStamp and the Message for the action
/// Use case: The user is asked to choose between convert, uppercase or reverse. If the selection is valid 
/// the logger displays a message in the form (ID, timestamp, Corvert/Uppercase/Reverse) when the request started
/// and another message when the resolver executed the action (ID, timestamp, sucessful message / error)
///
